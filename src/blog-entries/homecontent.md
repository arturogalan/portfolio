<!-- # Hi my name is **Arturo** and I,m a developer from Spain
I enjoy mixing music, javascript, css animations and HTML altogether in my never finished pet projects.

I work in [**Clarity.ai**](https://clarity.ai/), a cool company where we're making a nice job bringing societal impact to markets and investors.
