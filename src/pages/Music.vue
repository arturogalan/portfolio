    # **Music**

    Life without music have not sense at all. Since I was aware music has always helped me to overcome difficult times and enjoy the funny ones.
    # Influences

    When I was a child, in the road trips we used to listen to bands like Dire Straits, Queen, Bob Marley, The Beatles and other 80's classics. During my adolescence I grew up listening to punk-rock, metal, heavy etc... with bands like Nofx, Metallica, Pantera, Propagandhi etc... 
    Now I can say that I listen to a wide variety of styles includind classical music, emo, punk-rock, progressive metal and even dark music.

   I started playing guitar with eleven or twelve years old, and I recorded a couple of demo tapes with my two best friends both self produced at home and in the rehearsal room. Our band is called **`xInerzia`** The first demo was recorded in 2007 and the second one in 2015. They are available in [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/73ERX68cf82PuX4fdhLRq4?si=u6I72TZrSWeHcC0LToodqg).

    Unfortunately we had to stop years ago but I keep playing guitar at home and I'd like to record more stuff and songs that I have written during this years. I'm also starting to learn Violin, an incredible instrument that I have always wanted to play, it's extremely difficult but I keep the faith ðŸ˜….
