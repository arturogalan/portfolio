    # **About**

    Hello world! My name is Arturo GalÃ¡n and I'm a Frontend Engineer at Clarity.ai
    I wanted to do this site to write down some post about tech and robots, to post about music and to have a place where I can explain my projects and give them some visibility.
    I started writting a post in Medium but I thougt that making my own site could be intereseting to practice some CSS and design stuff, to test Quasar Framework and to deal with platforms like netlify.

    # Career

    I've been working since 2000 with computers, with languages and libraries like Java, Java Swing, Jsp, JQuery, PL-SQL . I have developed software and technology solutions for big Banks working in big Spanish technology consulting firms. Some years ago I realized that what I like most is developing frontend stuff and work with Javascript ecosystem in front and back. I really like the **Javascript** versatility, the functional way of programming, the freedom that its weakly typed nature gives you.

    Now I can say that I'm really proud of being a full time frontend developer in a startup called Clarity.ai where we work with Vue.js to provide a nice user experience.
    Clarity has a clear mission: To provide a decision tools to understand and optimize the societal impact of invesment portfolios.

    During my career I've been working under roles like Analyst, Organic Analyst, Functional Analyst, Technical Referent, Architect, Technical Architect ðŸ’¤...
    
    But... you know what? I've been always a **Developer**, nothing more and nothing less. A developer who enjoy coding, learning from other developers, using programming to build tools that mix technology and art.
    
    # This site

    I've develop this site using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev/). I've deployed it with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and you can see all the code in [Github](https://github.com/arturogalan/portfolio). Maybe I should have used a static generator but I'd like to make some posts about Vue.js and I want to have the possibility of putting real Vue components inside the blog.
